# MNFSR IT System – Testing & Quality Assurance Plan

## Document Information
- **Project**: Digital Transformation of MNFSR
- **Client**: Ministry of National Food Security & Research (MNFSR), Pakistan
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: September 2025
- **Prepared By**: SOFT PYRAMID

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Defines the end-to-end testing strategy and quality controls for the six-module MNFSR system, ensuring correctness, performance, security, and compliance within the 12-week implementation timeline.

---

## 2. Testing Strategy
- Shift-left testing; automation-first where feasible
- Risk-based prioritization; critical-path workflows prioritized for early validation
- Parallel test streams per module; shared services tested centrally

---

## 3. Test Types & Scope
- Unit Tests: .NET (xUnit/NUnit), frontend (Jest/Vitest); coverage targets ≥ 80–90% for core
- Integration Tests: service-to-DB and service-to-service; contract tests (Pact)
- System Tests: end-to-end user journeys across modules
- API Tests: Postman/Newman collections in CI
- Performance Tests: k6 for load/stress/soak; SLAs per module (2–3s response)
- Security Tests: SAST, DAST (OWASP ZAP), dependency scans; authz tests
- UAT: scenario-based testing with MNFSR stakeholders per module
- Accessibility Tests: WCAG 2.1 AA automated checks + manual sampling

---

## 4. Environments
- Dev: feature branches; ephemeral environments for PRs
- Staging: UAT replica with masked/synthetic data; performance baseline
- Production: smoke tests only; feature flags for gradual enablement

---

## 5. Test Data Management
- Synthetic data generators; anonymized datasets for analytics
- Data reset scripts; seed data for consistent runs
- Contracts with external APIs: mock servers (WireMock) for CI stability

---

## 6. Automation Frameworks & Tooling
- Backend: xUnit/NUnit, FluentAssertions, Respawn
- Frontend: Playwright/Cypress; axe-core for accessibility
- API: Postman/Newman; Dredd/Prism for OpenAPI contract validation
- Performance: k6, Grafana dashboards
- Security: SAST (CodeQL/SonarQube), DAST (OWASP ZAP), Dependency (OWASP Dependency-Check)
- Coverage: report thresholds enforced in CI

---

## 7. Manual Testing Procedures
- Exploratory testing charters for complex flows (approvals, renewals, grievance)
- Regression checklists aligned with RTM
- Cross-browser/device matrix (last 2 years per RFP)

---

## 8. Performance Criteria & Benchmarks
- PATP dashboards: p95 < 3s, 10k concurrent users read-only
- KMS search: p95 < 2s for complex queries; uploads with progress tracking
- VMS/IMS/PSDP/IC operations: p95 < 2s typical CRUD
- BI refresh: incremental ≤ 30 minutes for daily loads

---

## 9. Security Testing Protocols
- Threat modeling validation; authn/authz test suites; session management checks
- Input validation fuzzing; file upload antivirus; secrets leakage scans
- VAPT schedule: quarterly (full), targeted post-major releases

---

## 10. UAT Procedures
- Entry criteria: feature complete, no open Sev1/Sev2 defects, RTM coverage ≥ 95%
- Stakeholder scripts by role (admin, manager, analyst, end-user)
- Exit criteria: all critical acceptance criteria met; training completed; sign-off recorded

---

## 11. Defect Management & Tracking
- Tooling: Jira or equivalent; severity (Sev1–Sev4); priority (P0–P3)
- SLAs: Sev1 fix ≤ 24h; Sev2 ≤ 3 days; Sev3 ≤ 2 sprints
- Root cause analysis for repeated incidents; escape rate monitored

---

## 12. Quality Gates & Criteria
- Code quality: lint clean; unit coverage ≥ 80%; critical vulnerabilities = 0
- Performance: meet SLAs at forecast load; error rate ≤ 0.1%
- Security: all High/Critical resolved before release
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA conformance report

---

## 13. Testing Timeline & Resources
- Weeks 1–3: Unit/integration setup, early API tests; baseline performance
- Weeks 4–8: System tests, performance tuning, security scans
- Weeks 9–11: UAT, regression, readiness assessments
- Week 12: Go-live smoke tests, hypercare readiness
- Resources: Dedicated QA per module + shared performance/security engineers
